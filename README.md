### 📌 Objective
Build and track multiple versions of a classification model that predicts which passengers survived the Titanic shipwreck using the Titanic dataset. The model development process is logged and monitored using MLflow.

### 🔧 Tools Used
- Python (Pandas, Scikit-learn)
- MLflow (for tracking experiments)
- Classification algorithms (Logistic Regression, Random Forest, etc.)

### 🚀 Features
- Data cleaning and preprocessing
- Feature encoding
- Training classification models
- Logging hyperparameters and metrics
- Comparing multiple model versions via MLflow UI
- (Optional) Serve model via MLflow REST API

### 📁 Files Included
- `titanic_model.ipynb`: Main notebook for model building and logging
- `titanic_data.csv`: Dataset
- `mlruns/`: MLflow run metadata (auto-generated)
- `screenshots/`: Screenshots of MLflow runs
